Sentiment-Based Text Summarization Tool
Overview
This project develops a Python-based NLP tool that summarizes text (e.g., news articles, reviews) by prioritizing sentences with strong positive or negative sentiment. It uses NLTK for text preprocessing, Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis, and NumPy for ranking sentences.
Goals

Build a tool to generate sentiment-driven summaries.
Demonstrate skills in NLP, Python, and machine learning for resume purposes.
Complete in one week (2 hours/day).

Day 1: Setup and Research

Set up Python environment and installed libraries: NLTK, Transformers, NumPy.
Tested NLTK sentence tokenization on a sample text.
Initialized GitHub repository.

Setup Instructions

Install Python 3.8+.
Install dependencies: pip install nltk transformers numpy.
Run day1_setup.py to verify setup and test tokenization.

Next Steps
